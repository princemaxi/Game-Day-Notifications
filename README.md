## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/princemaxi/Game-Day-Notifications
- cd game-day-notifications
3. Create an SNS Topic
- Navigate to the SNS service in the AWS Management Console.
- Click Create Topic ‚Üí Select Standard.
- Name the topic (e.g., gd_topic) and note the ARN.
- Click Create Topic.
4. Add Subscriptions to the SNS Topic
- Select your SNS topic and go to the Subscriptions tab ‚Üí Create Subscription.
- Choose your preferred protocol:
- Email: Provide a valid email address and confirm the subscription via the link sent to your inbox.
- SMS: Enter a phone number in international format (e.g., +1234567890).
5. Create SNS Publish Policy
- Go to IAM service ‚Üí Policies ‚Üí Create Policy.
- Under JSON, paste the content from policies/gd_sns_policy.json.
- Replace REGION and ACCOUNT_ID with your AWS region and account ID.
- Click Next ‚Üí Review, name the policy (e.g., gd_sns_policy), and click Create Policy.
6. Create an IAM Role for Lambda
- Navigate to IAM service ‚Üí Roles ‚Üí Create Role.
- Select AWS Service ‚Üí Choose Lambda.
- Attach the following policies:
- gd_sns_policy (created in step 4).
- AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole (AWS-managed policy).
- Name the role (e.g., gd_role) and save its ARN.
7. Deploy the Lambda Function
- Go to the Lambda service ‚Üí Create Function ‚Üí Author from Scratch.
- Enter a name (e.g., gd_notifications) and select Python 3.x as the runtime.
- Assign the IAM role (gd_role) to the function.
- Upload the code from src/gd_notifications.py into the function editor.
-  Add environment variables:
- NBA_API_KEY: Your SportsData.io API key.
- SNS_TOPIC_ARN: The ARN of the SNS topic created earlier.
- Click Create Function.
8. Set Up Automation with EventBridge
- Navigate to EventBridge ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Create Rule.
- Set the event source to Schedule ‚Üí Use a cron expression for regular updates.
- Example (hourly updates): 0 * * * *
- Set the target to your Lambda function (gd_notifications) and save the rule.
9. Test the System
- Open the Lambda function in the AWS Console.
- Create a test event to simulate execution.
- Verify that notifications are sent to your email/SMS subscribers.
